 * 3 Born - triggered by the [BORN] command, associated monikers are the parents.
 * 4 Aged - reached the next life stage, either naturally from the ageing loci or with [AGES]
 * 5 Exported - emmigrated to another world
 * 6 Imported - immigrated back again
 * 7 Died - triggered naturally with the death trigger locus, or by the [DEAD] command
 * 8 Became pregnant - the first associated moniker is the child, and the second the father
 * 9 Impregnated - first associated moniker is the child, second the mother
