	Detects empty LOOP statements which cause infinite loop exceptions
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
	LOOP, UNTL, and EVER are executed in an instant, which means an empty LOOP statement takes no time to run,
	So the loop never completes, and no code is run during this time, causing the game to lock up and
	an error to be thrown.
