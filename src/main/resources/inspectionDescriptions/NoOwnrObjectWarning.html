<p>Highlights commands used without OWNR, that will fail silently and without error
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->

	Some CAOS commands require an OWNR to work properly, but can still be called without one
	in these cases, no error is generated by the Creatures runtime, but the value
	may not be what one would expect.
